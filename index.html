        <p> Rainwater is one of the most important natural resources for the Waorani people, yet it is variable and unpredicatable, so each drop is coveted.</p>
        <p> As communities grow, their need for potable water increases, and the dry months compound scarcity even more. </p> </div>

        <p> The melding of cultures--ancient and modern, indigenous and foreign--is leading to a noticeable loss of ancestral knowledge, native language, and generational separation.</p>
        <p> The Waorani culture is transforming. Some might say it is disappearing. This reality deserves attention on behalf of the next generation.  </p> </div>

        <p> Because of the wealth of oil reserves beneath Yasun√≠ National Park, several roads have been built through the jungle in the last 40 years.</p >
        <p> The Waorani have established communities at an exponential rate along the roads, and they have become dependent upon buses operated by oil companies for transportation. </p></div>
